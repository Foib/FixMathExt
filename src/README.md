# FixedMathExt - 64 bit Fixed Point Library

## Overview
This library provides 64 bit (31.32) fixed point arithmetic operations for fixed point numbers ('Fix64') as well as vector and matrix types.

## Features
- **Fix64 Type**: The main fixedp oint type, "Fix64", is a 64 bit fixed point number with a 31 bit integer part and 32 bit fractional part.
- **Vector Types**: The library includes vector type such as 'Fix64Vec2' and 'Fix64Vec3' for 2D and 3D vectors.
- **Matrix Type**: The library provides a 3x2 matrix type, 'Fix64Mat3x2', suitable for transformations in 2D space.
